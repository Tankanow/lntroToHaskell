== Introduction
Good news, everyone. I'm learning Haskell. No this doesn't mean my affair with
Clojure is over ... or that I can't wax poetic about the beauty of Groovy/Java8,
especially with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud making microservices fun.

This repo will be my attempt at http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/[Yorgi's Introduction to Haskell]
course.
