== Introduction
Good news, everyone. I'm learning Haskell. No this doesn't mean my affair with
Clojure is over ... or that I can't wax poetic about the beauty of Groovy/Java8,
especially with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud making microservices fun.

This repo will be my attempt at http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13[Yorgi's Introduction to Haskell]
course.

== Buck
As I explore more programming languages I am drawn to the https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-4.html[primal].
I find power in pattern matching, recursion, lazy evaluation, and elemental data
types. Haskell is the Ghost Dog in the Alaskan wilderness. It's power matched
only by the http://learnyouahaskell.com/starting-out#ready-set-go[wonderful]
https://getpocket.com/a/read/338908253[cartoons] and free books available online.
Also, it's probably my best chance at understanding monads.

== Help
I love learning. If anyone happens across this repo and notices me doing
something *Very Wrong* or evenly slightly non-idiomatic, please submit a
pull request or flame me on reddit.

Cheers,

Adam
